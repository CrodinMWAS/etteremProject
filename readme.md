# Duties

We've seperated ourselves into two pairs:
- Backend Team: Prém Ferenc + Gál Bálint
- Frontend Team: Kun Attila + Nagy Martin Márk

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Technologies used: ASP.NET, C# WPF, MYSQL.

At first we prioritised creating our SQL tables, simultaneously the ASP.NET API endpoint was being created, and we started designing and developing our WPF pages. Issues were assigned on jira, and whenever questions arose during development, we supported each other.
> All administrative duties (like Jira) were handled by the project lead.
